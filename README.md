# ScriptScript (◕‿◕)

Why should you use this programming language? You shouldn't

## Syntax and stuff

It's not fully finished but yeah, very simple
```
var x str = Hello
var y str = World

print(x + y)
```
Javascript output:
```
var x = "Hello";
var y = "World";
console.log(x + y);
```

File format is .ss (it's literally a text file just renamed)

## Contributing / setup
1. Get Visual Studio Code
2. Get Node.js
3. Open terminal => `node compiler.js`

Once I finish the compiler/transpiler into JavaScript I might look into compiling into C or NASM so that we could use it with killmeOS
